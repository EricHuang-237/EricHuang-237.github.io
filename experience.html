            <li>This study investigated the effects of aminated and carbonylated modified graphene on neurons and explored the effect of them at different concentrations on neuronal survival and growth. It was determined that 2μg/mL aminated graphene has the best promoting effect on neuron growth.</li>
            <li>Using graphene in electrospinning technology to prepare the neural catheter stent materials, we explore the effect of using graphene and silk fibroin with different ratios on the survival and growth of neurons and determined the 3% ratio of graphene/silk fibroin Protein materials have good mechanical and electrical properties and contribute to the development of neurites.</li>

            <li>We designed a platform for stretching the rat spine to make a mechanical injury (10% maximum amplitude and 60mm/h pulling speed)</li>

            <li>We prepared the PLGA/Fe3O4 magnetic particles with different morphologies and sizes (Spherical, rod-shaped, and red blood cell-like particles) at an average diameter of 5μm</li>
            <li>We investigated the best range of the concentration of these kinds of particles at about 510μg/mL. (comparing the absorbing efficiency, cell viability, neurites number, and axon length). Similarly, we choose the intensity range of the external magnetic field</li>
            <li>We successfully controlled the direction of neurites by using this tool: after absorbing a certain number of magnetic particles, the neurons can be stretched by an external magnetic polar</li>

            <li>In this project, we first applied flow shear forces of different strengths to neurons, and found that a flow shear force of 10 dyn/cm2 had a significant effect of promoting apoptosis on neurons.</li>
            <li>We transfected neurons with adenoviruses containing SIRT1-RNAi and wild-SIRT1 plasmids, and then applied flowing shear stress on the transfected neurons. It was found that SIRT1 can significantly inhibit the apoptotic effect induced by flowing shear stress.</li>

            <li>In this subject, a dumbbell-shaped micropattern was designed according to the morphological characteristics of neurons.</li>
            <li>According to the diameter of the neuron cell body, the micropatterns with side lengths of 30μm and 40μm were designed, and the corresponding PDMS stamps were prepared.</li>
            <li>Using FN and Laminin as the “inkpad” to culture neurons, it was found that the 40μm dumbbell shape can significantly increase the connection and guidance between the protrusions, and promote the formation of a planar network of neurons.</li>

            <li>We designed and produced a combined force-electric stimulation device that can apply electric field stimulations of different types, strengths, and frequencies to multiple groups of cultured cells while maintaining static tension on the cells, thereby roughly simulating the mechanics and mechanics of spine development.</li>
            <li>We chose 50-500mV external DC voltage and 2.5%-10% stretch amplitude as stimulation conditions, and observed the condition of neurons in each group. The expression of the neural guidance molecule Netrin1 and its inhibitory receptor UNC5 was tested. Conditions suitable for neuron growth and development were proposed.</li>
